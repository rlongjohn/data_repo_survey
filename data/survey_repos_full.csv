The system is designed to leverage all relevant existing data resources and provides a framework for a broader distributed data system.","https://www.marine-geo.org/about/contact.php,info@marine-geo.org",disciplinary,401 at MGDS,2003,eng,"3 Natural Sciences,313 Atmospheric Science and Oceanography,31302 Oceanography,314 Geology and Palaeontology,315 Geophysics and Geodesy,34 Geosciences (including Geography)",https://www.marine-geo.org/collections/#!/collection/MARGINS#summary,"Images,Raw data,Scientific and statistical data formats,Structured text,other",dataProvider,"bathymetry,cruises,earthquake,gravity,magnetics,rock samples,sediment samples,seismic reflection data,seismology,seismometer studies,sidescan sonar,sound velocity data,tectonophysics,water column XBT","Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory,GeoPRISMS,Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance,Marine Geoscience Data System,National Science Foundation","USA,USA,AAA,USA,USA","technical,general,general,general,technical,funding","non-profit,non-profit,non-profit,non-profit,non-profit","MARGINS Data Policy,MGDS Terms of Use,NSF Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE) Sample and Data Policy","https://www.nsf-margins.org/DataPolicy.html,https://www.marine-geo.org/about/terms_of_use.php,https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf17037&org=NSF",open,,,,"embargoed,open",,CC,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/,restricted,other,,,unknown,"https://www.marine-geo.org/tools/web_services.php,https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms",DOI,https://www.marine-geo.org/about/terms_of_use.php,,yes,,"ISO 19115,other","http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/iso-19115,http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/abcd-access-biological-collection-data","MARGINS is now GeoPRISMS In October 2010, the MARGINS Office at Lamont winds down, replaced by the first GeoPRISMS Office, at Rice.",2014-01-13,2021-12-17

Its main tasks are the computer-aided provision, processing and evaluation of historical research data, the development of theoretically consolidated normative data and vocabularies as well as the further development of methods in the context of digital humanities, research data management and quality assurance.
The ""Historical Data Centre Saxony-Anhalt"" sees itself as a central institution for the data service of historical data in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt and is thus part of a nationally and internationally linked infrastructure for long-term data storage and use. The Centre primarily acquires individual-specific microdata for the analysis of life courses, employment biographies and biographies (primarily quantitative, but also qualitative data), which offer a broad interdisciplinary and international analytical framework and meet clearly defined methodological and technical requirements. The studies are processed, archived and - in compliance with data protection and copyright conditions - made available to the scientifically interested public in accordance with internationally recognized standards. The degree of preparation depends on the type and quality of the study and on demand. Reference studies and studies in high demand are comprehensively documented - often in cooperation with primary researchers or experts - and summarized in data collections. 
The Historical Data Centre supports researchers in meeting the high demands of research data management. This includes the advisory support of the entire life cycle of data, starting with data production, documentation, analysis, evaluation, publication, long-term archiving and finally the subsequent use of data. In cooperation with other infrastructure facilities of the state of Saxony-Anhalt as well as national and international, interdisciplinary data repositories, the Data Centre provides tools and infrastructures for the publication and long-term archiving of research data.

    Weather, seasonal forecasting and climate.

For instance, the provision of data on currents, winds and sea ice help to improve ship routing services, offshore operations or search and rescue operations, thus contributing to marine safety.

The service also contributes to the protection and the sustainable management of living marine resources in particular for aquaculture, sustainable fisheries management or regional fishery organisations decision-making process.

Physical and marine biogeochemical components are useful for water quality monitoring and pollution control. Sea level rise is a key indicator of climate change and helps to assess coastal erosion. Sea surface temperature elevation has direct consequences on marine ecosystems and appearance of tropical cyclones. As a result of this, the service supports a wide range of coastal and marine environment applications.

The databases come from the work of institutional researchers, doctoral students, master students, private companies and archaeological services. They are stored on the TGIR Huma-Num service grid and archived as part of the Huma-Num/CINES long-term archiving service. Because of their sensitive nature, which could lead to the looting of archaeological deposits, access to the tool is reserved to archaeological professionals, from research institutions or non-profit organizations. Each user can query online all or part of the available databases and export the results of his query to other tools.","contact@arkeogis.org,https://arkeogis.org/contact/",disciplinary,,,"deu,eng,fra,spa","1 Humanities and Social Sciences,101 Ancient Cultures,10104 Classical Archaeology,102 History,11 Humanities,3 Natural Sciences,34 Geosciences (including Geography)",https://arkeogis.org/home/,"Scientific and statistical data formats,Structured text",dataProvider,"Link Open Data,Open Source,Rhine Valley,métadonnées,système d'Information Géographique","Huma-Num,University of Strasbourg","FRA,FRA","technical,general","non-profit,non-profit",General Terms and Conditions of Use,https://arkeogis.org/general-terms-and-conditions-of-use/,open,,CC,https://creativecommons.org/,"embargoed,restricted",registration,"CC,other","https://creativecommons.org/about/cclicenses/,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/croll/arkeogis-web/master/LICENSE",restricted,registration,,,MySQL,https://arkeogis.org/,hdl,,other,yes,other,Dublin Core,http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards/dublin-core,GitHub: https://github.com/croll/arkeogis-web,2021-08-09,2021-08-19
